            <div class="box1">
                <p>Step into any ROCKEY BURGERS, and you’ll notice we’re different.
                    From our famous (free) house-made pickles, to the hand-painted
                    signage, to our cheerful staff, we build our restaurants like we build
                    our burgers–sustainably, locally, and with an unwavering commitment
                    to quality.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="box2">
                <p>Fresh, quality produce, meat, dairy and buns, sourced from partners
                    located just miles from our restaurants, are the ingredients to making
                    the perfect burger. This commitment to creating the best possible food
                    for our guests is a direct reflection of our promise of creating fast food
                    burgers using slow food values.</p>

                Our burgers, fries, and shakes are made with the finest,

                    <div class="shakeDes">
                        All of our shakes and cones are made with organic cream from
                        Rockey Creamery, a small, family-owned, organic farm located South
                        of Nephi, Utah.

                        Our buns are baked to our specification by an artisan baker in Nephi,
                        UT.

                        All our beef is Rockey Farms, humanely-raised, vegetarian-fed,

                    <div class="potatoDes">
                        The potatoes we use to make our French fries are made from
                        potatoes grown in North America by growers who are required to
                        identify the genetic source of their seed potatoes. We do not work with
                        genetically modified potato varieties. Our potatoes are processed
                        fresh off the field and delivered to us without any modifications. We
                        proudly serve Sir Kensington ketchup.
